## Differences against google codelab.

- `Scaffold` is being used instead of `Surface` in `OnCreate` function.
- Because of the above point we had to use `innerPadding` feature.
- And also, we had to apply the `fillMaxSize` to `Column` itself, so that we can arrange the texts to the middle of screen.
- Note: Read the differences between `Scaffold` and `Surface`. And `Scaffold` was added instead of `Surface` in the code file by Android Studio itself.
